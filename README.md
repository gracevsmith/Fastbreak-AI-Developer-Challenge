Explanation for choice of Search Implementations
| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------| -----| -----|
| OpeanAI Embeddings + Vector Search | <ul><li>Considered very accurate wrt capturing semantic meaning (due to high-dimensional vector embeddings) </li><li> Compatible with Python </li></ul>| <ul><li>Pretrained on unknown data (introduces biases that will be hard to account for) </li><li> Generally computationally expensive </li></ul>|
| Algolia with AI Search | <ul><li> Semantic search built in (their method seems conceptually similar to vector embeddings) </li><li> Less expensive than vector embedding methods </li><li>Typo tolerance </li><li> Compatible with Python</li></ul> | <ul><li> Pricing for more advanced versions </li><li> dfhsd </li></ul> |
